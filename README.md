# 5MW-Grid-Connected-PV-system-3-phase-inverter-
MATLAB/Simulink model of a 5 MW grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) system using a 3-phase inverter. The project includes MPPT control, DC-link voltage regulation, LCL filter design, and grid synchronization. It demonstrates PV power conversion, inverter control, and grid power transfer under varying irradiance and temperature conditions.
